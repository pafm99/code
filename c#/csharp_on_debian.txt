Installing C# on Debian

apt install mono-mcs
and optionally

apt install monodevelop
if you want something more like an IDE.

mcs is the compiler. You can run the compiled program with mono prog.exe (or as ./prog.exe with binfmt_misc support enabled, which I believe Debian will do by default).

Is there something like a prompt where I can try running snippets of code?
apt install mono-csharp-shell
and then

$ csharp
Mono C# Shell, type "help;" for help

Enter statements below.
csharp> Console.WriteLine("Hello world!")
Hello world!
csharp>
